### Shop Inventory

Build an app which allows a shopkeeper to track their shop's inventory. This is not an app which the customer will see, it is an admin/management app for the shop workers.



#### MVP

* The inventory should track individual products, including a name, total stock quantity, stock currently leased, stock still available, and selling price.

* The inventory should track customers, including a name, and which products they are subscribed to. DONE

* The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit customers and products separately.

* Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view. DONE

* As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.

#### Priority List

1. For the products - render the stock and selling price (any thing from the database) - DONE

2. In the seed file - create a dummy 'No customer' entry - DONE

3. Create New Customers
    - a form which will enable you to put in new customer details (name)
    - Post that to the database so that it saves

4. Create New Products
    - a form which will be able to create a new product (including all the details)
    - Make sure new products are assigned to the 'No Customer' entry





















































#### Possible Extensions

* Calculate and display current total income per product.

* Calculate and display current total income per customer.

* Each product is meant to be on lease to a customer for 1 month, so a countdown timer?

* Filter the inventory list by customer. For example, provide an option to view all products bought by a certain customer.

* Categorise the products by two categories.   Provide an option to filter the inventory list by these categories.
